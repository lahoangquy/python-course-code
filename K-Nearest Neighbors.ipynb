In KNN, the prediction of a new data point is based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of its nearest neighbors in the feature space.\n","\n","The key idea behind KNN is to find the K closest data points (neighbors) to the new data point based on a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance. The distance metric measures the similarity or dissimilarity between data points in the feature space.\n","\n","The steps involved in the KNN algorithm are as follows:\n","\n","Choose the value of K: Determine the number of nearest neighbors (K) to consider when making predictions. The choice of K can significantly impact the performance of the algorithm and may require experimentation.\n","\n","Calculate distances: Compute the distance between the new data point and all other data points in the training dataset. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and cosine similarity.\n","\n","Find K nearest neighbors: Identify the K data points with the smallest distances to the new data point. These data points are considered the nearest neighbors.\n","\n","Majority vote (for classification) or averaging (for regression): For classification tasks, assign the class label that is most frequent among the K nearest neighbors to the new data point. For regression tasks, calculate the average of the target values of the K nearest neighbors and use this value as the predicted target value for the new data point.\n","\n","KNN is a non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm, meaning it does not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data and instead relies on the local neighborhood of data points for making predictions. This makes KNN particularly useful when the data distribution is not well understood or when the decision boundary is complex and nonlinear.\n","\n","However, KNN has some drawbacks, including the need to store all training data points (which can be memory-intensive for large datasets) and the computational cost of computing distances during prediction. Additionally, the performance of KNN can be sensitive to the choice of distance metric and the value of K."],"metadata":{"id":"dXOTZc3QrSll"}}]}
