They are based on Bayes' theorem, which describes the probability of a hypothesis given the evidence.\n","\n","Despite their simplicity, Naive Bayes classifiers are powerful and widely used in various applications due to their efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness, especially in text classification tasks such as spam filtering and document categorization.\n","\n","The key assumption of Naive Bayes classifiers is that features are conditionally independent given the class label, which means that the presence or absence of a particular feature is independent of the presence or absence of other features, given the class label. This assumption is often unrealistic in practice, but Naive Bayes classifiers can still perform well even when it is violated.\n","\n","The steps involved in training and using a Naive Bayes classifier are as follows:\n","\n","Model Training: Given a labeled training dataset consisting of input features and corresponding class labels, the Naive Bayes classifier estimates the conditional probability of each feature given each class label using the training data.\n","\n","Feature Independence Assumption: The classifier assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label. This assumption allows the classifier to calculate the joint probability of all features given the class label as the product of the individual conditional probabilities of each feature.\n","\n","Prediction: To predict the class label of a new instance, the classifier calculates the posterior probability of each class label given the input features using Bayes' theorem and selects the class label with the highest posterior probability as the predicted class label for the new instance.\n","\n","There are different variations of Naive Bayes classifiers, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes, which are suitable for different types of data and feature distributions.\n","\n","Overall, Naive Bayes classifiers are simple yet effective algorithms for classification tasks, especially in scenarios with high-dimensional data and large feature spaces. They are particularly well-suited for text classification tasks due to their efficiency and ability to handle sparse and high-dimensional feature vectors."],"metadata":{"id":"zW8BPdljpyBz"}}]}
