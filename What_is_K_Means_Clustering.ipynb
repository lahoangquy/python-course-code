        "K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a predetermined number of clusters. The goal of K-means clustering is to group similar data points together and minimize the within-cluster variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Initialization: Choose the number of clusters (K) and randomly initialize K cluster centroids. These centroids represent the initial cluster centers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid based on a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance. This step forms K clusters based on the initial centroids.\n",
        "\n",
        "Update Centroids: Recalculate the centroids of the clusters by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Repeat: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence, which occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "K-means clustering aims to minimize the within-cluster variance, which is the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned cluster centroid. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to clusters and updates centroids to minimize this objective function.\n",
        "\n",
        "K-means clustering is sensitive to the initial choice of centroids and may converge to a local minimum depending on the initialization. To mitigate this issue, the algorithm is often run multiple times with different initializations, and the solution with the lowest within-cluster variance is selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "K-means clustering is widely used for various applications, including customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems. It is computationally efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large datasets. However, it requires specifying the number of clusters beforehand, which can be challenging in practice. Additionally, K-means assumes clusters to be spherical and of similar size, which may not always hold true for complex datasets."
