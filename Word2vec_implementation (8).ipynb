This means the tokenizer will only keep the most common 15000 words as the vocabulary. When we restrict a vocabulary this way a new problem arises. As the tokenizer's vocabulary does not encompass all possible words in the true vocabulary, out-of-vocabulary words (or OOV words) can rear their heads. Some soluations are to replace OOV words with a special token (such  as <UNK>) or remove them from the corpus. This is possible by passing the string we want to replace OOV tokens to the oov_token argument in the Tokenizer. In this case, we will remove OOV words. If we are careful when setting the size of the vocabulary, omitting some of the rare words would not harn learning the context of words accurately\n",
