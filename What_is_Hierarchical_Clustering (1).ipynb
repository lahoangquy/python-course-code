        "Hierarchical clustering is a method used in machine learning and data mining to group similar data points into clusters based on their characteristics or features. Unlike flat clustering algorithms, which produce a single partition of the data, hierarchical clustering creates a tree-like hierarchical structure of clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "In hierarchical clustering, the process starts by treating each data point as its own cluster. Then, pairs of clusters are iteratively merged together based on their similarity until all data points belong to a single cluster or until a specified stopping criterion is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main types of hierarchical clustering:\n",
        "\n",
        "Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering: This is the most common type of hierarchical clustering. It begins by considering each data point as a separate cluster and then iteratively merges the closest pairs of clusters based on a distance metric until all data points belong to a single cluster. The merging process continues until a stopping criterion, such as a predefined number of clusters or a threshold distance, is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "Divisive Hierarchical Clustering: In divisive hierarchical clustering, the process starts with all data points belonging to a single cluster, and then it recursively divides the clusters into smaller clusters based on some dissimilarity criterion until each data point is in its own cluster. Divisive hierarchical clustering is less common than agglomerative clustering and can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hierarchical clustering produces a dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram that illustrates the merging process and shows the hierarchical relationships between clusters. The dendrogram can be cut at different levels to obtain different numbers of clusters, allowing users to explore the data at different granularities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hierarchical clustering does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand, making it suitable for exploratory analysis and visualizing the structure of the data. However, it can be computationally expensive for large datasets, and the choice of distance metric and linkage criteria can significantly affect the resulting clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, hierarchical clustering is a flexible and powerful technique for grouping similar data points into clusters and is widely used in various fields, including biology, image analysis, and social sciences."

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\\nin \\\"equivalent time\\\" or in \\\"real time\\\" sampling mode (equivalent time\\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling\\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\\n\\nIs the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\\n\\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\\nof the scope.
