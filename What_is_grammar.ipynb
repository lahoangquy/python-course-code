        "In natural language Processing (NLP), grammar refers to the rules and structures that govern the formation of sentences in a language. These rules dictate how words can be combined to create meaneing ful and gramatically correct sentences. Grammar encompasses various aspects including sysntax, mor phology and semantics\n",
        "1) Syntax: Syntax deals with the arrangement of words and phrases to form well-formed sentences. It involves understanding the roles of different Parts of speech (e.g nouns, verbs, adjectivces) and how they relate to each other within a setence. Syntax rules specify the order of words , the agreement between subject and verb, the formation of words, the agreement between subject and verb, the formation of phrases and clauses, and the overall sentence structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Morphology:P Morphology is conred with the internal strucuture of words and how they are formed from smaller units called morphemes. Morphemes are the smallest units of meaning in a language  and they can be roots, prefixes, suffixes or inflectional endings. Morphology rules govern word formation including processes like derivation (forming new words from existing ones) and inflection (modifying words to indicate grammatical features like tense, number and gender).\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Semantics: Sematics deals with the meaning of words, phrases and sentences in a langugage . It involves understanding the relationships between words and their interpretations in various context. Semantic rules determine how words combine to convey specific meanings, how ambiguity is resolved and how language users infer meaning from lingusitic expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In NLP, grammar plays an important role ion tasks such as parsing, syntatic analysis and semantic interpretation. By understanding the grammar of a language, NLP systems can accurately process and understand natural language input, enabling various applications like machine translationm question answering and text generation."
