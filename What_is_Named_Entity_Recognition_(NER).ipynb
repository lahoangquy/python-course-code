        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and classifying entities within a text in predefiend categories. Entities refer to specific objects such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates and other important information in the text. The Primary goal of Named Entity Recognition is to extract and label these entities to provide a structured representation of the content.\n",
